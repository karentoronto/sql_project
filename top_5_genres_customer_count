SELECT  
	D.customer_id,D.first_name, D.last_name, B.city,C.country,
	SUM(E.amount) AS Total_Revenue
FROM ADDRESS A
INNER JOIN CITY B ON A.CITY_ID = B.CITY_ID
INNER JOIN COUNTRY C ON B.COUNTRY_ID = C.COUNTRY_ID
INNER JOIN customer D ON A.address_id= D.address_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON D.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY B.city, C.country, D.customer_id
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5

Step 2  Find the top 5 genres of these customers using the customer IDs
SELECT F.name AS genre, COUNT(B.rental_id) AS frequency
FROM customer A 
INNER JOIN payment B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN rental C ON B.rental_id = C.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory D ON C.inventory_id = D.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film_category E ON D.film_id = E.film_id
INNER JOIN category F ON E.category_id = F.category_id 
WHERE A.customer_id IN (148,526,178,137,144)
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 5
